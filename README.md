# Tumor-Detection-app-MATLAB
A MATLAB App Designer project for medical image analysis that detects brain tumors in MRI scans using pixel intensity. The app overlays heatmaps for tumor visualization, provides staging based on tumor size, and includes accessibility features like text-to-speech and colorblindness simulation to make medical imaging more inclusive.
